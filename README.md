# Generating the title of an article based on its brief description (abstract). Based on [Stepik Samsung AI NLP course](https://github.com/Samsung-IT-Academy/stepik-dl-nlp))
## To create a title from your own annotation, you can use the command interface 
```
python generate.py
```
Also it is required to download model [weights](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1bViYmiR3Oibl36DApEk_qGaupIsguXP-/view?usp=sharing) and unarchive it on same folder with script
## Few examples
